# NLP-Final-Project
Text Summarization
Goal: We plan on implementing text summarization from scratch. However we aim to focus more on the two types of summarization, Extractive and Abstractive. Once we have these both implemented we will use ROUGE metrics to find the optimal model to summarize text.
